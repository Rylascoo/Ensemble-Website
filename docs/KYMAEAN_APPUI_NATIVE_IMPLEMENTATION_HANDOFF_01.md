# KYMAEAN APPUI Native Implementation Handoff 01

Status: **ACTIVE DESIGN-TO-NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION CONTRACT / Q-PROD-01 / PROVISIONAL PRODUCT BUILD**

Date: 2026-09-16

## 1. Trigger and purpose

Engineering `main@933edb017c29389f573bb1d86202676fef64fa63` activates Q-PROD-01 under the Director product-build-ahead amendment. Real product construction, a native ARM64 Windows shell, and UI/design implementation convergence may proceed before deferred E0 validation closes. This supersedes the earlier implementation-prerequisite hold without rewriting its historical evidence.

This handoff tells the first native shell what current Design authority requires. It does not select WinUI control classes, own Engineering architecture, or convert design-reference evidence into shipping validation.

Machine-readable companion: `docs/evidence/APPUI_01_NATIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE_MAP_01.json`.

## 2. Product spaces are not automatically navigation labels

Engineering correctly owns the product-semantic spaces **Studio / Stage / Archive**. Current Design law separately owns how those meanings are presented.

The Phase-1 map explicitly rejects the recovered `Studio / Stage / Archive` permanent top-level navigation topology. APPUI-COMP-02 instead validates quiet durable **Home / Productions / Settings** routes with current Production/current situation dominant.

For Q-PROD-01:

- **Studio semantic space** maps to the accepted **Production-shaping / current-possibility** workspace. It is situation-first inside the current Production; `Studio` is not required as a visible permanent label.
- **Stage semantic space** maps to the **Live Stage** workspace. It is entered from the current Scene/live context and may become the dominant task surface without becoming mandatory durable global navigation.
- **Archive semantic space** maps to **causal/history + deep inspection**. History is discoverable and can become deep task space, but Design does not make Archive/History a permanent top-level destination by default.

Native routing should therefore model these semantic destinations independently from their visible labels and global-nav placement.

## 3. First native shell reference

Preserve the current APPUI shell behaviors unless native evidence proves a platform contradiction:

- current Production scope and current situation dominate durable navigation;
- Home / Productions / Settings remain the current design-reference durable routes;
- switching Productions is a transient scope-change surface;
- collections prefer quiet rows/separators over repeated cards;
- deep inspection is task depth, not a new permanent silo;
- Back/Close are navigation and never causal Undo;
- healthy persistence remains quiet;
- infrastructure failure remains outside fiction.

`PKT-COMP-02-01` through `PKT-COMP-11-01` remain the real-shell integration evidence. The first native scaffold need not implement every later component at once, but it must not choose architecture that makes those accepted behaviors impossible.

## 4. Visual implementation references

Use the selected static design mechanisms as provisional implementation inputs:

- Light F2 roles: Field `#F4F3F7`, Primary `#221B2D`, Secondary `#5C5565`, Accent `#006F73`, Boundary `#7D7486`, Soft surface `#EAE8EF`.
- Dark D3 roles: Field `#19141D`, Primary `#F4F0F5`, Secondary `#BEB4C0`, Accent `#249A9C`, Boundary `#756A79`, Soft surface `#261F29`.
- MAT F1: one continuous authored field with subtractive/edge-open channels; do not turn the shell into a card dashboard.
- TYP F1 + Source Sans 3: preserve `eyebrow < state/support <= body < heading`; Source Sans 3 is the design-reference family, not yet a production font package.
- STA F2: focus is an independent outer solid ring (`2px` / `2px` offset research reference); selection is a persistent structural edge witness.
- FICON F1 + `PKT-FICON-ASSET-01-01`: use system-backed Segoe Fluent Icons for the eight frozen conventional verbs; 20px is the primary design-reference size.
- Stage: `PKT-STAGE-CORE-02` remains source authority; S1 from `PKT-APPUI-STAGE-PRESENTATION-01` remains the shell-facing static presentation reference; Stage stays dark in both app themes.

These are not permission to invent final resource-key names or claim production token stability.

## 5. First-slice acceptance target

The native Q-PROD-01 fixture/demo path should be able to prove, at minimum:

1. a native shell opens around a deterministic local Production fixture;
2. current Production/current situation remains obvious;
3. Home / Productions / Settings reference navigation stays visually subordinate to the task;
4. routing can enter the shaping/current-possibility semantic space, Live Stage, and history/deep inspection without requiring permanent Studio/Stage/Archive tabs;
5. Light and Dark preserve identical meaning around an invariant dark Stage surface;
6. keyboard focus and selection remain distinct;
7. Back/Close restore prior task/focus without mutating Production truth;
8. no provider/model/E0 machinery leaks into ordinary creator vocabulary.

The native implementation should measure its actual minimum-window behavior rather than claiming the browser `320px` reference is a Windows minimum-size requirement.

## 6. Placeholder law

Q-PROD-01 is provisional product implementation. The shell scaffold may temporarily use:

- a platform/system font while Source Sans 3 packaging/localization is unresolved, clearly treated as non-final;
- a dark Stage placeholder or non-shipping local S1 reference while a shipping Stage asset path is unresolved;
- deterministic fixture content for Product-open controls, provided the fixture does not present invented commands as final semantics.

Placeholder implementation cannot supersede Design authority by becoming convenient code.

## 7. Engineering choices left open

Engineering retains authority for:

- WinUI control classes and view-model architecture;
- resource dictionary organization and provisional key names;
- native windowing/minimum-size behavior;
- package/runtime/performance/accessibility validation;
- font packaging/subsetting/localization implementation;
- image asset loading/packaging;
- persistence/provider/Application contracts;
- source/test organization.

Design reviews the resulting native surface against this contract after Engineering produces evidence.

## 8. Native review return packet

Return to Design Sol when the first shell scaffold exists with:

- exact Engineering commit/ref;
- native ARM64 launch evidence on SurfSeven;
- Light and Dark screenshots of the same fixture state;
- route/state map showing semantic destination versus visible label/global-nav placement;
- keyboard traversal/focus-return evidence;
- high-contrast observation;
- actual minimum-window behavior;
- list of Design references/assets consumed and any intentional placeholders;
- any native constraint that forces a deviation from this handoff.

A native constraint is evidence for Design convergence. It is not permission to silently change the Design system.

## 9. Explicit non-authority

This handoff does not freeze final Product navigation taxonomy, shipping typography/icon/Stage packages, motion, Scene/Take/Rehearsal/branching/Perspective/provider/Performer semantics, WACK/Store behavior, or final architecture. Deferred E0 evidence may still require provisional product code to change.
