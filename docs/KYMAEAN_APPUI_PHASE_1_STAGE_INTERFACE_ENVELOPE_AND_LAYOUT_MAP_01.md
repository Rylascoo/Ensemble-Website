# KYMAEAN APPUI PHASE 1 — STAGE INTERFACE ENVELOPE + LAYOUT MAP 01

Status: **ACTIVE PHASE-1 DESIGN LAW / STRUCTURAL MAP / NO NEW STAGE VISUAL AUTHORITY**

Date: 2026-09-14

Purpose: define the functional space the future Stage and its surrounding live workspace must be able to support before the application layout is visually hardened.

This document implements the Director-approved sequence:

1. application UI architecture and layout;
2. Stage and live-production experience;
3. Kymaean design-language integration.

Phase 1 may reserve space, relationships, state witnesses and transitions required by Stage semantics. It must not invent unresolved Stage controls, replace `PKT-STAGE-CORE-02`, or begin new Stage visual-language work.

## 1. Authority boundary

Design authority resides in `Rylascoo/Ensemble-Website` plus authenticated Design Drive assets. `Rylascoo/Ensemble-Project` is read-only input for product/runtime/architecture truth that materially changes what the UI must communicate.

Current Engineering checkpoint at map creation: `main@36b9c4c2644d6d47c957e7910d0c609e260b5432`, still pre-product-runtime Phase D. Exact final Scene lifecycle, consequence review, Presentation Perspective control, minimum Stage semantics and Another Take/branch/rehearsal scope remain later Engineering/Product decisions.

## 2. Core rule

The Stage is not one rectangular control containing every live-production function.

Phase 1 must distinguish four layers:

```text
L0  APPLICATION SHELL
    durable app / Production scope

L1  LIVE-WORKSPACE FRAME
    current Scene context + semantic status + contextual commands + inspector host

L2  STAGE FIELD
    dark theatrical field where people, relationship, attention and performed action dominate

L3  TRANSIENT / DEEP TASK SURFACES
    intervention, Character-bounded performance, history/cause, consequence review, capability detail
```

A function belongs inside the Stage field only when it is part of experiencing the live scene. Creator machinery, deep explanation and diagnostic infrastructure stay outside unless later product evidence proves otherwise.

## 3. Stage-field baseline

The current Stage visual baseline remains `PKT-STAGE-CORE-02`.

Phase 1 must preserve capacity for:

- persistent displayed Character identity;
- one presence carrier per displayed Character in the current baseline;
- explicit name/identity anchoring;
- truthful listening / active-state separation;
- current performed action, dialogue, silence or refusal as live-scene meaning;
- materially relevant Director attention/opportunity;
- materially relevant relationship salience;
- a dark shared Stage field in both application themes.

The frozen five-Character composition is the current visual baseline only. It must not become a product-wide cast-cardinality assumption. Phase 1 layouts must leave Stage adaptation beyond five Characters open.

The Stage field does **not** currently freeze:

- timer or Pause behavior;
- transcript/performance-text placement;
- right-rail/provenance semantics;
- Observed Cues;
- exact relationship arcs or pips;
- provider/model/cost placement;
- exact attention/opportunity visualization;
- exact consequence or history presentation.

### 3.1 Stage-field semantic strata

The Stage field must separate two kinds of visible state:

- **performance semantics** — Character presence/identity, performed action or silence, truthful state, materially relevant attention/opportunity and relationship salience;
- **interaction witnesses** — hover, selected entity, keyboard focus, hit target and other session/navigation state used to operate the UI.

Interaction witnesses may appear on or around a Character presence so the Stage is operable, but they must never look like fictional attention, relationship change, emotion, consequence or Character agency. Selection is not Director attention. Keyboard focus is not selection.

### 3.2 Stage placement envelope

| Meaning / function | Phase-1 placement expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Character presence + identity | Stage field |
| live action / dialogue / silence / refusal | Stage meaning; exact text/render placement remains open |
| Director attention/opportunity | Stage must be able to communicate it when materially relevant; visual treatment open |
| relationship salience | Stage-capable when truthful/material; exact arcs/geometry open |
| hover / selection / keyboard focus | Stage interaction witness allowed, non-fictional and semantically separate |
| Production / Scene identity | live-workspace frame, not Character carrier |
| Presentation Perspective | workspace semantic status/control; not a decorative Stage effect |
| creator intervention commands | outside Character carriers; exact transient surface open |
| selected-entity inspector | adjacent/deep surface, invoked from Stage or elsewhere |
| causal history / consequence detail | adjacent/deep surface, not permanent Stage chrome |
| provider/model/cost diagnostics | outside Stage by default |
| transcript, timer/Pause, provenance rail, Observed Cues | placement unresolved; reserve capacity without freezing |

## 4. Live-workspace frame

The live-workspace frame surrounds the Stage without competing with it. It owns information necessary to understand or operate the current live context but not intrinsic to the theatrical field.

It must be able to host, when relevant:

- Production identity;
- current Scene identity/context;
- current Presentation Perspective when disclosure materially differs;
- current-versus-historical witness;
- capability/unavailable status when it affects an action;
- selected-entity context;
- contextual creator commands;
- inspector entry/exit and focus return;
- supporting performance material when Stage placement is not appropriate;
- return-to-current behavior after deep inspection.

## 5. Transient and deep task surfaces

These surfaces temporarily become more prominent when the user asks for explanation, authority or bounded performance. They do not become permanent top-level application modes merely because they are important.

Phase 1 must reserve coherent transitions for:

- creator intervention / direction;
- Character-bounded performance (`Take a Seat` lineage) without leaking privileged creator information;
- causal-history inspection from a current condition or accepted event;
- consequence review / `what changed?` where later product authority requires it;
- historical inspection with explicit return to the current Production;
- capability/error explanation;
- future Take/rehearsal/branching surfaces if Phase D authorizes them.

The exact control taxonomy and labels for these surfaces remain open.

## 6. Semantic distinctions that must survive every layout

Phase 1 layouts must provide an accessible home for these distinctions without exposing internal E0 machinery:

| Product meaning | Layout requirement |
| --- | --- |
| current vs historical | always discoverable; history inspection cannot masquerade as current state |
| provisional/non-effective vs effective/accepted | distinguishable without relying on color alone |
| selected Character/entity vs Director attention/opportunity | separate concepts; selection must never imply narrative attention |
| creator command vs Character agency | creator intervention remains outside Character presence carriers |
| Presentation Perspective | discoverable whenever it materially changes disclosure |
| capability available vs unavailable | truthful task status; provider failure cannot become fictional behavior |
| navigation vs causal mutation | Back/close/selection never changes Production truth |
| Character identity vs Performer assignment | persistent Character identity must survive recasting and context changes |

## 7. Phase-1 task-dependent layout family

Phase 1 does not seek one fixed dashboard. It defines a small family of layouts sharing the same shell and semantics.

### 7.1 Production / resume workspace

Purpose: re-enter the Production and understand the current situation quickly.

Primary emphasis:

- Production identity and current Scene;
- current people / relevant conditions;
- concise current pressure or unresolved situation;
- resume/current action;
- causal context only when useful.

The Stage may appear as a preview or resume target, but should not dominate when no live performance is active.

### 7.2 Production-shaping / current-possibility workspace

Purpose: shape the people, circumstances, relationships, knowledge boundaries, pressures and Scene conditions that make future performance possible without exposing engine/schema machinery as the creator experience.

Primary emphasis:

- persistent Production context;
- people and relationships as first-class creative material;
- current/world circumstances and Scene setup;
- knowledge/disclosure boundaries where product authority permits;
- pressures, goals, possibilities and unresolved conditions in human-readable form;
- contextual editing and inspection rather than a universal configuration dashboard.

This workspace inherits the recovered desktop explorations' strong asymmetric hierarchy and detail inspection, but not the historical Studio label or a fixed ontology-shaped panel grid.

### 7.3 Live Stage workspace

Purpose: experience and operate the current performance.

Primary emphasis:

- Stage field as the largest contiguous surface;
- minimal persistent Scene/Production/Perspective anchors;
- contextual commands outside the Stage field;
- selected Character/context inspector adjacent when invoked;
- supporting performance text/history subordinate to people and action.

This workspace must be able to become visually sparse during Watch posture and denser only when the creator deliberately inspects or intervenes.

### 7.4 Deep inspection workspace

Purpose: let a Character, relationship, condition, accepted event or causal path temporarily receive more room without becoming a permanent app silo.

Primary emphasis:

- selected subject remains tied to the same Production/current Scene;
- current state remains visibly retained when inspecting history;
- causal provenance, consequence and unresolved movement may become denser;
- return to the prior current focus is explicit;
- inspection itself never mutates authority.

### 7.5 Character-bounded workspace

Purpose: support the creator temporarily performing through one Character's permitted information position.

Primary emphasis:

- same Production and Character identity;
- materially changed disclosure, not merely a cosmetic theme;
- creator-only information removed or inaccessible as required;
- permitted current context and observable cues become primary;
- action/speech/silence remain available forms of agency;
- clear return to the prior creator context.

### 7.6 Empty / unavailable / transitional states

The same shell must remain coherent when there is no active Scene, no Character selection, no provider capability, provisional material awaiting a later product decision, loading/recovery work, or a cancelled/failed attempt.

These states are Phase-1 architecture tests, not decorative illustration opportunities.

### 7.7 Component-coverage requirements

The Phase-1 layout family must also reserve coherent homes for four cross-workspace component families confirmed by the component-coverage audit. These are capacity requirements, not final control designs.

- **Whole-Production Character management.** The creator must be able to reach, create, edit and inspect persistent Characters beyond the current Scene without forcing `People` into a mandatory permanent top-level silo. Participation/cast controls remain product-open.
- **Truth / knowledge / disclosure inspection.** Deep inspection must be able to represent authoritative fact, claim, belief, suspicion, memory, withheld/private information and provenance where Product authority supports those distinctions. Character-bounded views must enforce permitted disclosure. Recovered `Claims & Truth` / `Who Knows What` layouts are inspiration only.
- **Persistence / recovery status.** Healthy persistence should remain quiet, while saving, recovery, corruption, read-only or persistence failure must have a truthful semantic witness and a path to explanation. Persistence state must never be fictionalized as Character behavior.
- **Production lifecycle utilities.** The shell or Production scope must reserve a route for settings, portable import/export, provider configuration, diagnostics and recovery utilities. Exact portable format, provider/cost policy and utility commands remain Product/Phase-D dependent.

Recovered artwork also demonstrates manuscript/transcript, session/relationship map, Takes, performer assignment and provider controls. Phase 1 reserves capacity only where current Product semantics require it; these historical controls do not become authority by repetition.

## 8. Spatial hierarchy rules

Recovered UI explorations may inform composition, but not restore obsolete navigation or product semantics.

Phase 1 should carry forward these useful layout behaviors:

- stable scope/context remains visually quieter than the current task;
- the primary work surface receives the greatest area and strongest hierarchy;
- contextual inspection appears adjacent on wide layouts rather than replacing the task by default;
- density changes by task: Live Stage sparse, setup/history/deep inspection denser;
- columns may be asymmetric; equal card grids are not a default goal;
- supporting information may move below or behind progressive disclosure rather than permanently consuming Stage width;
- selected-object detail is unmistakable without portrait-only or color-only identity;
- high-consequence creator commands are visually distinct from passive information.

The recovered `Studio / Stage / Archive` labels and navigation topology remain historical exploration only.

## 9. Adaptive layout contract

### Wide desktop

Preferred relationship:

```text
[quiet durable scope] [dominant primary task / Stage] [adjacent inspector when invoked]
```

Supporting transcript/history may occupy a subordinate lower or contextual region only when needed.

### Medium desktop

The primary task remains dominant. Navigation and inspectors may collapse, overlay, or become temporarily substituted surfaces while preserving the same semantic relationships.

### Narrow desktop

One primary surface is shown at a time. Inspectors and deep detail become sequential/overlay surfaces with predictable Back/close behavior. No essential meaning may depend on simultaneous columns.

## 10. Light / Dark contract

Light and Dark are co-equal presentations of one semantic system.

Phase 1 must therefore keep constant across themes:

- layout hierarchy and navigation meaning;
- Stage geometry and dark Stage presentation;
- control availability and state meaning;
- selected-object relationships;
- inspector behavior;
- current/history and provisional/effective distinctions;
- focus order and accessibility semantics.

Theme may change shell surfaces, text, borders, separators and semantic brush values. It must not create a second information architecture.

In Light theme the dark Stage may read as a contained theatrical chamber. In Dark theme it may integrate more continuously with the shell. That perceptual difference is acceptable so long as meaning and hierarchy remain equivalent.

## 11. Accessibility and state grammar

Every Phase-1 composition must preserve:

- keyboard access to durable scope, primary work surface, inspector and commands;
- meaningful focus return when transient surfaces close;
- selection distinct from keyboard focus;
- Character identity independent of portrait recognition or color alone;
- current/historical and provisional/effective distinctions without color alone;
- Presentation Perspective exposed semantically when active;
- causal/history content in a meaningful reading order;
- reduced-motion compatibility;
- high-contrast survivability;
- scalable text without requiring precise spatial interpretation.

## 12. Explicit anti-patterns

Phase 1 must not:

- turn the live Stage into a chat transcript with decorative Character markers;
- use a permanent dashboard grid merely to fill desktop space;
- make History a permanent top-level destination by default;
- treat Presentation Perspective as a cosmetic theme or permanent top-level page;
- expose E0 enum names, hashes, orchestration IDs or subsystem names as normal creator vocabulary;
- conflate selection, attention/opportunity, relationship salience or Character agency;
- hide creator-authority actions inside Character presence carriers;
- imply five Characters is the maximum or required cast size;
- make provider/model identity dominate ordinary creative work;
- use constant animation, polling or ambient computation merely to make the shell feel alive;
- introduce ornament that changes information architecture before Phase 3.

## 13. Phase-1 composition sequence

The next visual work should proceed in this order:

1. structural grayscale/wireframe map of the four interface layers;
2. Production/resume workspace in wide Light/Dark shell;
3. Production-shaping/current-possibility workspace;
4. Live Stage workspace in wide Light/Dark shell using unchanged Stage baseline;
5. selected-Character inspector state;
6. deep causal/history inspection state;
7. Character-bounded state;
8. empty/unavailable/error/provisional/effective states;
9. medium and narrow adaptations;
10. recursive hierarchy/accessibility/theme-parity audit;
11. only then a Phase-1 freeze candidate.

No Phase-2 Stage visual successor is opened during this sequence.

## 14. Phase-1 exit criteria

Phase 1 is complete only when all are true:

- every current Design-baseline and product-semantic Stage-envelope requirement has a coherent home or transition;
- no unresolved Phase-D item had to be invented as a final control to make the layouts work;
- Production/resume, Production-shaping, Live Stage, deep inspection and Character-bounded compositions feel like one application rather than separate products;
- Light and Dark preserve one semantic hierarchy with the same dark Stage;
- wide, medium and narrow/adaptive behavior preserves meaning;
- selected entity, attention/opportunity, Perspective, capability and current/history status remain distinguishable;
- empty, loading, unavailable, historical and provisional/effective states do not require information-architecture redesign;
- recovered UI-layout inspiration improves hierarchy and density without reviving obsolete product modes;
- whole-Production Character management, truth/knowledge/disclosure inspection, persistence/recovery status and Production-level utilities each have a coherent route without freezing unresolved Product controls;
- accessibility/state grammar survives without color, portrait or animation dependence;
- a fresh read of `Ensemble-Project` finds no promoted product-runtime semantic that invalidates the envelope.

## 15. Phase-2 entry gate

Before Stage/live-production visual design begins:

1. fresh-resolve `Rylascoo/Ensemble-Project` authority;
2. determine whether post-E0 Phase D has frozen any previously open Stage/Scene/Perspective/Take/consequence semantics;
3. update this envelope first if those semantics changed;
4. only then open a Stage visual successor under normal Design authority.

If Engineering is still pre-Phase-D, Phase 2 may explore only the product meanings already authoritative; it must continue to leave unresolved controls provisional.

## 16. Non-authority

This map does not freeze final navigation labels, exact pixel dimensions, WinUI controls, typography, palette, materials, motion, transcript placement, timer/Pause, provider/cost UI, Take/rehearsal/branching UX, or any Microsoft Store/runtime implementation claim.

It defines **where meaning must be able to live before visual polish begins**.
