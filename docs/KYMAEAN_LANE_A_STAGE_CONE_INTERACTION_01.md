# KYMAEAN LANE A — STAGE CONE INTERACTION 01

Status: QUALITATIVE INTERACTION GRAMMAR / TIMING UNFROZEN  
Date: 2026-09-05

## Director decision carried forward

The selected Stage carrier is **Characters as volumes of light on a dark floor** and the selected geometry is **cone**.

This study asks how the creator should perceive and interact with that carrier before motion timing is calibrated from Read-Through evidence.

## Interaction thesis

The cone is **presence**, not a button.

A Character may have a large semantic hit target for pointer/touch/accessibility, but visible interaction feedback should concentrate around the Character's floor pool, name and redundant identity cue. Drawing a container around the full cone makes the Character read as a card, portal or selectable software object and defeats the reason cone was selected.

The critical state separation is:

`USER SELECTION != CURRENT OPPORTUNITY != SPEAKING != TAKE A SEAT`

Selecting or focusing a Character must never nominate them, force a response, interrupt another Character, alter Director authority or mutate Production history.

## State grammar

### REST

The Character remains visibly present with near-still light and restrained internal texture.

Rest should not use an obvious breathing/pulsing loop. Constant rhythmic motion reads as a toy or status indicator rather than presence.

### CURRENT OPPORTUNITY / ANTICIPATION

Opportunity is known before a Performance occurs, making anticipation a unique Stage asset.

The floor pool may broaden and the cone may gain restrained internal energy. The change says **this Character may act**; it must not promise speech or imply obligation.

The explicit Character name/state remains available so the meaning does not depend on colour or motion.

### SPEAKING / PERFORMING

Speaking intensifies the same carrier rather than replacing it with transcript chrome.

Candidate directions for later timing calibration:
- slightly brighter internal core;
- more coherent / faster internal texture;
- a tighter, clearer floor pool;
- performance text remains spatially related to the ensemble rather than becoming a chat bubble attached to an avatar.

Exact durations and reveal rhythm remain unfrozen.

### LISTENING

A non-speaking Character should not simply dim into inactivity.

Listening retains readable presence. Later motion work may test tiny receptive changes in internal texture or floor emphasis, but must not invent emotional state, intent or observation authority.

### USER FOCUS / SELECTION

Pointer click, touch or keyboard focus may select a Character for creator inspection.

Visible response:
- focus/selection treatment around the name + floor relationship;
- optional contextual creator actions outside the cone;
- the cone itself remains materially unchanged.

The first render used a full-height rounded selection outline around the cone. Audit rejected it because it converted the Character into a UI card/container. That treatment is superseded.

Selection is persistent creator focus only. It does not create fictional action.

### TAKE A SEAT

Take a Seat is an explicit action after Character selection, not an automatic consequence of touching the cone.

Entering:
- preserve the same Character cone;
- mark the floor/name region as the creator's occupied seat;
- change shell state to `Perspective: <Character> · Posture: Perform`;
- preserve deterministic Character-bounded information authority.

Returning:
- restore `Perspective: Creator · Posture: Watch`;
- remove the occupied-seat treatment;
- Character selection may remain as creator focus;
- do not invent a new Current Opportunity or Performance.

## Interaction placement

The full Character region may be the semantic hit target, but the visible feedback should not reveal that rectangular target.

Creator actions should appear in contextual chrome adjacent to the Stage or through an equivalent progressive surface, not as buttons painted inside the light.

`Intervene` remains a Stage/creator-authority action, not a hidden cone gesture. A user should not need to infer that clicking or dragging a Character changes narrative authority.

## Accessibility boundary

Identity and state must remain recoverable without:
- colour;
- internal texture/motion;
- exact spatial position;
- pointer hover;
- portrait recognition.

The study therefore retains Character name, stable programmatic identity and a neutral redundant shape cue. The neutral cue is test instrumentation, not selected final Character symbolism.

Keyboard focus must be visible without requiring a full-cone container.

## Prototype evidence

`prototypes/lane-a/stage-cone-interaction-01.html`

The prototype exposes Rest, Current Opportunity, Speaking, Listening, user selection, bounded-perspective inspection, Take a Seat and return to Creator + Watch.

Browser-level assertions verify:
1. speaking state can be applied independently of user selection;
2. selecting Wren does not grant Wren Current Opportunity;
3. Take a Seat changes shell state to `Perspective: Wren · Posture: Perform`;
4. returning restores `Perspective: Creator · Posture: Watch`.

## Timing boundary

CSS transitions in the prototype are perceptual scaffolding only.

Do **not** promote their durations, texture rates, beat timing or reveal cadence into design authority. Final motion/pacing numbers require the Read-Through and real transcript rhythm evidence.

## Current design judgment

The cone is strongest when the user experiences it as an actor's **place in the room**, not as an avatar.

The floor pool and name are the interaction hinge. The cone above them carries presence and state change. This gives Kymaean a useful duality:

- **look at the cone** to feel who is present and what is changing;
- **act at the floor/name relationship** when the creator wants to inspect or occupy that Character.

This distinction should survive into implementation unless Read-Through or real usability evidence falsifies it.
